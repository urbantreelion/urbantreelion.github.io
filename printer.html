                <p class="info"> <em class="date"></em></p>
                <p>

                This is a personal hobby which I have come to love and learn lots about. I first purchased the purchased the printer in October of 2017 and since then have put on hundreds of hours of print time. There have been many failures since I have started but with every failure has come an opportunity to hone the printer’s ability in my pursuit of the best printer possible. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I had two goals with this printer when I started: first was to create the quietest printer possible. While this is still on going, the noise level of the printer now is far lower than when I started. From changing the extruder fan to building an enclosure, I can now print all through the night and not be disturbed. The second goal was to modify the printer into the best possible machine for under $1000. While I am still far under the $1000 limit, the printer is consistently producing professional grade products.

                  <h3>Printer Modifications</h3>

                  <p>
                  The current list of upgrades on this printer include: Z-axis brace and gantry extensions, a glass bed with PET sheet, a milled aluminum bed undercarriage, y-axis belt tensioner, gantry feet, and a custom-made enclosure. There are a couple more modifications on the way which include a 360-degree cooling fan shroud for the hot end and a 120 mm fan for the power supply unit. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So far, the most important modification for this printer is the z-axis braces. These provide structural rigidity for the gantry arm which tends to wobble when the printer reaches print heights above ~100mm. These vibrations or wobbles will cause what are know as artifacts in the print which will appear as extra horizontal lines or ‘ringing’. Basically, the print wont look as nice!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Another important modification is the enclosure. This enclosure allows the printer to have an ambient temperature of 30-35 degrees and eliminate virtually all drafts. Since building the enclosure I have not had any problems with warping of my prints (where the print delaminates from the bed). This has allowed me to complete longer prints with a far higher success rate.

                  <h3>Print Settings</h3>

                  <p>
                  From supports to infill, the settings of your print can make or break it. The first and most important setting is the temperature of your print. For fused filament fabrication (FFF) or fused deposited material (FDM) printing, the temperature will depend on the type of filament you’re using and your printer environment. Some brands of filament can be up to 20 degrees different from another, and the colour will also play a role. Black filament will often need slightly lower temperature than a white filament as will purple versus clear. The environment you print in plays a huge role in the temperature settings of your print. A room at 25 degrees with no air flow will need a lower temperature than a room at 10 degrees with drafts. A simple fix to this is to build an enclosure for the printer, which will help provide a stable ambient temperature as well as eliminate drafts.

                  <br>
                  The next step in having a successful print is the cooling. A print with 360 degrees of cooing will have a more even finish when compared to the stock cooling fan on most printers. However, cooling depends on the material being used. ABS filament is extremely susceptible to layer cracking as the material can cool very rapidly. To reduce this, cooling must be turned of for almost all ABS prints. PLA on the other had benefits from more cooing. Undersides and sloped pieces will have smoother exterior finishes when cooled effectively.

                  Another setting worth noting is the infill of a print. There are two properties of a print that will give it strength: the infill (both density and type), and number the shells. A print that is being designed to be a functional piece may benefit from having three exterior walls, or shells, to give it more strength. This can also be said for the infill and infill type. The percent of infill is largely based on the shape of the piece being printed. Pieces that have lots of angles to them can better distribute the forces applied to them, but pieces with large, flat surfaces will need an infill that suits its needs. Honeycomb is a great infill that provides strength to the print in multiple directs. However, it requires more material than your standard grid pattern. So, what is the best method to choosing your infill patter? Practice! The more you print, the more you will understand your printer and your prints.
